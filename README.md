<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This project aims to develop a system that assists users in achieving their health and fitness goals by recommending default diets based on their BMI and enabling them to build customized diets. The system will also provide users with insights into the nutrient content of various foods through visualizations, helping them make informed decisions about their dietary choices. To achieve this, the system will leverage Tableau to create interactive and informative visualizations of food and nutrient data. The system will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. By providing users with personalized diet recommendations and valuable nutritional information, the app aims to help users make healthier choices and improve their overall health and well-being.</p>

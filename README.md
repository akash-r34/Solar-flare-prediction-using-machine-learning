<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This project focuses on predicting solar flare peak current per second (c/s) and energy magnitude using a variety of recurrent neural network architectures, including LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM + GRU. Through systematic hyperparameter tuning, we aim to optimize model performance, offering an advanced tool for forecasting solar activities with enhanced accuracy and reliability. The project is implemented in a modular and transparent manner, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of space weather prediction. The codebase is available on GitHub, providing an accessible platform for further exploration and collaboration.</p>
